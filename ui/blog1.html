      <p>College of Engineering, Pune (COEP) is an autonomous engineering college affiliated to Savitribai Phule Pune University in Pune, Maharashtra, India. Established in 1854, it is one of the oldest engineering colleges in Asia, after IIT Roorkee (1847). The students and alumni of College of Engineering, Pune are colloquially referred to as COEPians. The college's study model was referred to, in the early 1950s, as the "Poona Model".

College of Engineering, Pune is located at the confluence of the Mula river and Mutha river..</p>

      <p><b>History</b><br>The college was one of the first few colleges established by the British to serve the Indian subcontinent. The foundation stone of the new college was laid by the Governor, Sir Bartle Frere, who was to become the Vice-Chancellor of the University, on 5 August 1865. Initially, it was started as the "Poona Engineering Class and Mechanical School" to train subordinate officers for carrying out public works like buildings, dams, canals, railways and bridges. In July 1857, Henry Coke was given the charge of the institute. Admission was open to all, irrespective of nationality or caste. The certificate course was converted into a degree course and the first class of the Bachelor of Engineering degree graduated in the year 1912. After the University of Poona (now Savitribai Phule Pune University) was established in 1948, the college became affiliated to the new university. In 1968, the three-year degree was extended to 4 years constituting 8 semesters.

      In 2003, the institute was granted complete autonomy by the State Government of Maharashtra, thus giving it the freedom to set its own curriculum and manage its own finances. With permanent affiliation to the Savitribai Phule Pune University, the institute now is an autonomous engineering school. This has been the biggest change as far as pedagogy at COEP is concerned. The following years have seen a multitude of positive changes in administration and academic strategies.</p>
      
     <p><b>Specializations and departments</b><br>
      At present, the college awards the degree of B.Tech., i.e. Bachelor of Technology (earlier the Bachelor of Engineering or the B.E.) in nine specialisations. They were introduced subsequently since the inception of college.
